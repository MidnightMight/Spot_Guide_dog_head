Hi there, 
Trial_run_script: code for the trial run with head articulation and UDP communication

Spot_SDK communication attempt: The Spot control from a laptop is now feasible but the code was not utilised due to the fact that live camera feed is needed and as such the spot's original controller was used instead due to time constraints.
